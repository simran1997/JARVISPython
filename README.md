Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant?

Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.
In this project, I have implemented a simple speech recognition model o perform all of the above mentioned, that is a personal A.I. assistant using Python. 
A powerful programme which can perform your tasks with just few voice commands!
Just start the programme and let it run!
No need to start it again. Just let it run in the background and you are good to go.
A very memory efficient program, it doesn't take much of your memory!
Feel like a boss and start ordering
